I love [Python](http://www.python.org) more than it's healthy for a
man to love a programming language. Much of my job consists of me
trying to twist problems until I find a way I can go about solving
them by writing a Python program. Python is so flexible that in
general, not much twisting is required.

I'm a contributor to the [astropy project](http://www.astropy.org)
which aims to create a single core Python package for astronomy.

Many of the programs I use in my research are organised into a package
called Barak that you can find
[here](http://nhmc.github.com/Barak). It's on the Python Package Index
([PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi)), so you can simply install it
with ```pip install barak```. Take a look at some more of my
astronomy-related packages on [github](https://github.com/nhmc).
